NAME
	configure

DESCRIPTION
Configure Apigee CLI options. If this command is run with no arguments,
you will be prompted for configuration values of your profile. You can
configure a named profile using the --profile argument or a default pro-
file if no profile is specified.  If your config file does not  exist
(the default location is ~/.apigee/config), the Apigee CLI will create
it for you. To keep an existing value, hit enter when prompted to retain
the value currently present in the profile as displayed in [brackets].
If the config item has no value, it be displayed as  [None].

Note:  if you configure a basic auth client, the values  you  provide
will  be  written  to  the  shared  credentials  file (~/.apigee/credentials).
